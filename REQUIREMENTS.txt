================================================================================
1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Shared Table is a community gathering initiative in Baguio City where
strangers share a meal and unfiltered conversation. This application serves as
a digital companion to in-person gatherings, providing a structured yet
spontaneous way to surface conversation topics and questions.

The core function is a question randomizer. Before a meal, guests vote on
topics they find interesting. The app determines the group's top topics, and
throughout the gathering, each guest taps a button to receive a random
question drawn from those topics — which they then answer aloud at the table.

Platform        : Web application (single page application)
Target Device   : Mobile phones only (fixed mobile viewport; no responsive
                  breakpoints for tablet or desktop)
Language        : English only
Connectivity    : Assumes reliable internet connection

================================================================================
2. USER ROLES
================================================================================

ROLE            DESCRIPTION
-----------     ----------------------------------------------------------------
Organizer       Has access to the admin panel. Manages the master list of topics
(Admin)         and questions. Can view session history. May also act as a host.

Host            The person who creates a gathering session, shares the join
(Facilitator)   code/QR, and controls the session flow (confirming topics,
                advancing rounds, ending the session). One host per session.

Guest           A participant who joins a session via QR code or session code,
(Participant)   votes on topics, and picks questions during the gathering.

NOTE: In the initial release, the Organizer and Host may be the same person.
The system should be architected so that user roles can be extended in future
iterations (see Section 5).

================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1  ADMIN PANEL — TOPIC & QUESTION MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADM-01  The system shall provide a password-protected admin panel accessible
        only to organizers.

ADM-02  The admin panel shall allow organizers to perform the following
        operations on TOPICS:
          a. View all existing topics in a scrollable list.
          b. Add a new topic with a display name.
          c. Edit an existing topic's display name.
          d. Remove a topic from the master list.

ADM-03  The admin panel shall allow organizers to perform the following
        operations on QUESTIONS:
          a. View all questions grouped or filtered by topic.
          b. Add a new question and assign it to exactly one topic.
          c. Edit an existing question's text or reassign it to a
             different topic.
          d. Remove a question from the pool.

ADM-04  When a topic is removed, the system shall prompt the organizer to
        confirm, warning that all questions under that topic will also
        become unavailable.

ADM-05  The admin panel shall display the total count of questions per topic
        to help organizers gauge pool depth.

ADM-06  Topics and questions shall have no character limit enforced by the
        system, but the UI should gracefully handle long text with
        truncation or wrapping.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2  ADMIN PANEL — SESSION MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SES-01  The admin panel shall include a "Session History" section listing all
        past sessions (see Section 3.9 for record details).

SES-02  The admin panel shall allow organizers to view the details of any
        past session.

SES-03  The admin panel shall allow organizers to delete a session record.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3  SESSION CREATION (HOST/FACILITATOR FLOW)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCR-01  A host shall be able to create a new gathering session from the app.

SCR-02  Upon session creation, the system shall generate:
          a. A unique alphanumeric session code (short, easy to read aloud;
             recommended 5–6 characters, case-insensitive).
          b. A QR code that encodes the session join URL.

SCR-03  The session lobby screen shall display:
          a. The session code (prominently).
          b. The QR code (scannable by guests' phone cameras).
          c. A live list of guests who have joined, showing their nicknames.
          d. The current number of joined guests.

SCR-04  The host shall have a control to proceed from the lobby to the
        topic voting phase once all expected guests have joined. There is no
        enforced minimum or maximum guest count.

SCR-05  The host shall have the ability to end or close a session at any
        point during the gathering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4  SESSION JOINING (GUEST FLOW)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SJN-01  A guest shall be able to join a session by either:
          a. Scanning the QR code displayed by the host, or
          b. Manually entering the session code on the app's join screen.

SJN-02  After entering or scanning the code, the guest shall be prompted to
        provide a nickname (freeform text input).

SJN-03  The system shall validate that the nickname is:
          a. Not empty.
          b. Not a duplicate of another nickname already in the session.

SJN-04  Upon successful entry, the guest shall see a waiting/lobby screen
        confirming they have joined, displaying:
          a. The session code.
          b. The list of other guests who have joined (by nickname).

SJN-05  Guests shall not be required to create an account. Session access
        is ephemeral via the code/QR mechanism.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5  TOPIC VOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VOT-01  When the host advances to the voting phase, all guests shall
        simultaneously see the master list of available topics on their
        screens.

VOT-02  Each guest shall select exactly 3 topics from the list. The
        selection is unranked — all three carry equal weight.

VOT-03  The UI shall enforce the 3-topic limit:
          a. After selecting 3, further selections shall be disabled unless
             the guest deselects one.
          b. A visible counter (e.g., "2 of 3 selected") shall guide the
             guest.

VOT-04  Each guest shall confirm their selections by tapping a "Submit"
        button.

VOT-05  After submitting, the guest shall see a waiting screen indicating
        that the host is reviewing results.

VOT-06  The system shall tally votes and determine the top 3 topics by
        highest total vote count.

VOT-07  In the event of a tie for any of the top 3 positions, the system
        shall present the tied topics to the host for manual tiebreaker
        resolution (see Section 3.6).

VOT-08  The host's screen shall display the voting results in real time
        (or upon all guests submitting), showing each topic and its vote
        count, sorted descending.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6  TOPIC CONFIRMATION & REVEAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCR-01  After voting concludes, the host shall see a "Topic Results" screen
        showing the top 3 topics as determined by votes, along with all
        other topics and their vote counts.

TCR-02  The host shall have the ability to:
          a. Confirm the top 3 as-is, or
          b. Manually override the selection — swapping out a top-3 topic
             for a different one — before revealing to guests.
        This accommodates tiebreakers and facilitator discretion.

TCR-03  Once the host confirms the final top 3 topics, the host shall tap
        a "Reveal Topics" button.

TCR-04  Upon reveal, all guests shall see an announcement screen displaying
        the 3 chosen topics for the gathering.

TCR-05  After a brief moment (or a "Continue" tap from the host), the
        session shall transition into the question randomizer phase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7  QUESTION RANDOMIZER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QRN-01  During the question phase, each guest's screen shall display a
        prominent "PICK" button.

QRN-02  When a guest taps "PICK":
          a. The system shall randomly select one question from the combined
             pool of questions belonging to the session's 3 confirmed topics.
          b. The selected question shall be displayed on the guest's screen.

QRN-03  Once a question has been picked by any guest in the session, it
        shall be removed from the available pool for that session. No
        question shall appear more than once per session.

QRN-04  The guest shall NOT see the pool of available questions. They only
        see the result after tapping "PICK."

QRN-05  After picking a question, the guest shall answer it verbally at the
        table. The app does not collect typed responses.

QRN-06  The guest's screen shall display their picked question until the
        round advances or the guest is otherwise prompted.

QRN-07  If the available question pool is exhausted (all questions from the
        3 topics have been used), the system shall notify the host that no
        more questions are available.

QRN-08  The host's screen shall display a live overview showing:
          a. Which guests have picked a question in the current round.
          b. Which guests are still waiting to pick.
          c. The number of remaining questions in the pool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.8  ROUND MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RND-01  A "round" is defined as one cycle where each active guest picks and
        answers one question.

RND-02  The session shall support multiple consecutive rounds with no
        predetermined limit.

RND-03  After all guests in a round have picked a question (or the host
        decides to advance), the host shall be able to start a new round.

RND-04  At the start of each new round, all guests' "PICK" buttons shall
        become active again, allowing each guest to pick one new question.

RND-05  The question pool carries over across rounds — questions used in
        earlier rounds remain excluded.

RND-06  The host shall have the option to end the session after any round.

RND-07  When the host ends the session:
          a. All guests shall see a "Gathering has ended" screen with a
             closing message (e.g., "Thank you for sharing your table.").
          b. The session data shall be saved to the session history.
          c. Guest connections to the session shall be gracefully closed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.9  SESSION HISTORY & RECORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HST-01  Upon session completion, the system shall save a session record
        containing the following data:
          a. Session code.
          b. Date and time of the session (start and end).
          c. List of guest nicknames who participated.
          d. Number of guests.
          e. The 3 confirmed topics.
          f. The list of questions that were picked during the session,
             including:
               - The question text.
               - The topic it belonged to.
               - The nickname of the guest who picked it.
               - The round number in which it was picked.

HST-02  Session records shall be viewable from the admin panel
        (see SES-01 and SES-02).

HST-03  Session records are read-only. They cannot be edited after the
        session ends.

HST-04  Session records shall persist indefinitely unless manually deleted
        by an organizer (see SES-03).

================================================================================
4. NON-FUNCTIONAL CONSTRAINTS
================================================================================

These are not full non-functional requirements but constraints derived from
organizer decisions that shape development.

NF-01   The application shall be a Single Page Application (SPA).

NF-02   The UI shall be designed exclusively for a mobile viewport
         (approximately 360–414px width). No responsive breakpoints for
         tablet or desktop are required.

NF-03   The application shall be built assuming a reliable internet
         connection. Offline support is not required.

NF-04   All user-facing text shall be in English.

NF-05   The application architecture shall be modular and extensible to
         accommodate future features without significant refactoring
         (see Section 5).

NF-06   Real-time communication between the host and guests within a session
         (e.g., transitioning phases, updating the guest list, tracking
         picks) shall be handled via WebSocket or equivalent real-time
         protocol.

================================================================================
5. OUT OF SCOPE (FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS)
================================================================================

The following features are explicitly excluded from the initial release but
the application architecture should be designed with awareness of these
potential additions:

FUTURE-01   User account creation and management (login, profiles,
            persistent identity across sessions).

FUTURE-02   Role-based access control beyond the current admin/host/guest
            model.

FUTURE-03   Event scheduling and RSVP system for upcoming gatherings.

FUTURE-04   Post-gathering feedback or rating mechanism.

FUTURE-05   Multi-language support (e.g., Filipino).

FUTURE-06   Responsive design for tablet and desktop.

FUTURE-07   Offline or low-connectivity mode.

FUTURE-08   Analytics dashboard (e.g., most popular topics over time,
            average session size, guest retention).
